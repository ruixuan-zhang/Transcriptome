# Goal
This project is a basic pipeline for transcriptomic analysis.

* Data type: pair-end mRNA reads;
* Experiment design: time-course virus infection data without biological replicates
* Pipeline: Preprocessing (fastqc - mapping) - quantification and normalization - cluster analysis - DEG test - GO and kegg analysis
* Other: pathway and GO terms based heatmap
